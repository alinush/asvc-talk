    Given many $(\pi_i)_{i \in I}$, can aggregate into succinct \textbf{subvector proof} $\pi_I$.\pause

    \textbf{High-level ideas}, thanks to Drake and Buterin:\pause
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Each $\pi_i$ is a commitment to quotient $q_i$ of division $\frac{\phi(X)}{X-i}$\pause
        \item $\pi_I$ is a commitment to quotient $q_I$ of division $\frac{\phi(X)}{\prod_{i\in I} (X-i)}$ (see ~\cite{KZG10a})\pause
        \item Compute $c_i$'s such that $\frac{1}{\prod_{i\in I}(X-i)} = \sum_{i\in I} c_i \frac{1}{X-i}$\pause
        \item Then, $q_I(X) = \sum_{i\in I} c_i \cdot q_i(X)$\pause
        \item Thus, $\pi_I = \prod_{i\in I} \pi_i^{c_i}$
    \end{itemize}
